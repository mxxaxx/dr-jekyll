            The novel contains many biblical references. At the time, a majority of the population was religious, and the book uses the science vs religion to make its points. Robert Louis Stevenson was an atheist, while his father was a Calvinist. The Calvinist church was the main church of Scotland, and is a type of Protestantism based on John Calvin’s teachings. Stevenson felt that Calvinism was hypocritical as it revolved around being perfect, which contradicts human nature. This influenced his writing as his father did not approve of his decision to be an atheist, and it caused Stevenson great anguish as his relationship between his father was damaged. Religion invokes a sense a strong feeling of tradition, and it makes the text more serious. On the other hand, science is the logic and reasoning behind life, and it makes the text more tense, as science contradicts religion. The author makes sure that the reader is aware of this juxtaposition between science and religion, and it one of the premises for the book.

            Psychology and Sigmund-Freud
        </h1>

            The victorians where obsessed with the <b>supernatural</b><br>
            One of Robert Louis Stevensons, inspirations was sigmund-freuds classification system.<br>
            In said system Freud describes the mind to be made up of three elements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The id - The primitive part of a human which controls said individuals sexual desires.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The superego - An individuals moral conscience
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ego - The balance between the id and the superego
                </li>
            </ul>
            Hyde was an a representative of somebody controlled by his id. He acts instinctively and without further thought.<br>
            Dr Jekyll, on the other hand, symbolizes the ego. This is all very relevant to psychological landscape of the time.

            Stevenson went to Mr Henderson's School. Howbeit, due to his ill health<br>
            he was only able to spend a couple of weeks there. His ill health impacted the way he appoached<br>
            is novels, as in the opening of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hide, a childhood is unwell, due to being hit by a collosal man<br>
            Stevenson was also described as being odd looking and eccentric, which influenced the way he portrayed<br>
            In general, Stevensons's childhood wasn't the most pleasant and this reflects in his literary works.

            In Victorian society, the advancement of technologies and other scientific theories led to great improvements in the everyday lives of the population however this was only limited to the upper and middle class. Some of the greatest advances in technology made were –
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Great improvements to infrastructure which lead to a large increase in population.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Large medical advancements were made such as the invention of anaesthesia and the creation of antiseptic surgery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Widespread expansion of the countries railway network
                </li>
            </ul>
            Another predominant theme that is seen throughout the book is the scientific idea of Darwinism. Charles Darwin claimed evolution occurred through natural selection which created civil unrest as this idea went against the previous ones of religion. Darwinism can also be linked to the duality of man the novel is based on.
